0,A Goblin Fires an Arrow at You,"The little creature nocks an arrow in their bow, carefully aiming until they’re sure it will hit its target, and releases. The arrow flies toward you quicker than a bird, puncturing a small but painful hole in your body."
1,A Torn Page from Nuldy’s Compendium of Insect Inquiries,"In many regions of the civilized-yet-recluse world, communities are well acquainted with the infamous folklore of the Dung Beetle. These timid insects incite fear in commoners—they are a deadly infestation—and adventurers. Amassing large hoards of refuse, these beetles possess the innate magic to set dung on fire and fling it with amazing accuracy. Small explosions immediately follow something being hit by one of these flaming dung balls. A single Dung Beetle is manageable, but where there is one, there are said to be many more, and a swarm is a curse. Best to give this beetle plenty of space and keep your latrine clean."
2,Aberrant Spirit Creature,"Most creatures in the world are visible because of the reflection of light from their bodies provides the eye with an image for the brain to process. This creature is different, only visible because of the nimbus of red—mist? fire?—surrounding it. It slithers from the floor, up the wall, then into the air itself, unbound by gravity. Many eyes float around its shadowy form, which has a mantis-like head and large claws, behind which are a set of six chittering centipedal legs and a long tail crested with a fin. No smell accompanies this aberration, but a chill pervades the air around it, and the constant sound of screams and wails assault your ears."
3,Adult Brass Dragon,"Webbed fins unfurl from the neck of this massive draconic creature, and its ruddy brass scales catch the light of the sun brilliantly. It moves with a strange and alluring grace, watching you from a distance with eyes cunning and curious. The membrane of its wings extends down the length of the reptilian beast's tail, giving it the look of a robed figure. As you fully reckon its size, you're left in awe."
4,Air Elemental,"A contained haze—part mirage, part fog—whispers through the air. Roughly eight feet in diameter, the thing floats of its own accord, heedless of any wind. Questing appendages spin out of its form in tight whirlwinds to investigate the space around it."
5,Ancient Gold Dragon,You shield your eyes from the brightness of the vast and glittering body before you. Any light that strikes it seems to reflect tenfold; from between your fingers you can make out its vast draconic shape. You sense more than see that two infinitely wise eyes gaze benevolently upon you.
6,Ancient Red Dragon,"Centuries of creating terror, causing anguish, and fomenting chaos should weigh upon a soul. Some stain from the blood of countless dead should tarnish the body. But the beast before you seems utterly content and comfortable in its shining crimson scales. The dragon shrugs and settles its body like a cat—a cat that can crush a castle tower between its claws."
7,Aquatic Lawnmower Mimic,"
"
8,Astral Dreadnought,"At first, you aren’t sure what you’re seeing. It's simply a blackness in what is otherwise a sea of stars, moving slowly across your vision, but then one great yellow eye snaps open and a mouth opens out of the dark. The maw before you is massive, large enough to swallow whales whole, though there are rows of teeth as long as swords to ensure that whatever goes down that gullet would not do so in one piece. Two enormous crab-like pincers and a large serpentine-like body complete the gray-skinned monstrosity as it advances on your position."
9,Awakened Shrub with Club,"Brought into a semblance of sentient awareness by powerful magic, the shrub, indistinguishable at first from one of its stationary fellows, shambles forward on roots shaped like feet. It is difficult to distinguish its motivation: although it lacks facial features, it clutches a rude club in its twig-like fingers with a silent, businesslike determination."
10,Black Dragon Wyrmling,"The draconic creature, serpentine in appearance and roughly the size of a large dog, slithers toward you. Its eyes are sharp and cunning, its scales black like obsidian, its nostrils flared as it breathes in your scent. Hooked, wicked teeth flash as its maw gapes. Saliva drips, caustic, green, and hissing."
11,Bones of Big Animal in Swamp,"The skeleton of a massive, feline beast lies beneath the surface of the swamp. Massive, curving fangs and razor claws could not spare the predator its fate at the bottom of the fen, where the acidic waters slowly devour the bleached bones. As one passes, they might swear to see a ghostly light aglow in the sunken pits of the beast’s eye sockets."
12,Burrowing Wurm,"A huge and hideous wormlike creature burrows its way up through the ground, the earth crumbling down its thick, oozy body in a collapsing mess. It has no legs, only a bulbous body and a mouth filled with sharp teeth. It opens its maw in a sound not unlike a wooden plank being torn apart, and the smell of rotting meat fills the air."
13,Chitinous Yugoloth,"The thing before you is a horror of chitinous plates and fangs. A pair of wickedly barbed antennae twitch above its hate-filled eyes, and its hunchbacked body is supported by an atrophied pair of wings as well as forelimbs that end in talons. Stubby legs leave it unbalanced and lumbering, but that doesn’t seem to slow its inexorable approach. As it draws nearer, you see two spiked tentacles writhing from its back, each ending in a pair of cruel, hooked tips."
14,Colossal Dragon,"Lightning tears across the sky, leaving streaks across your retinas as if the tempestuous scenery were painted on a dome of cracked porcelain, each piece poised to sunder. While some jagged lines fade from view, others remain—those of the gigantic mountains ahead of you. Then there’s a shudder, as if the very cliffs are collapsing, and you edge forward to catch sight of a rockslide that does not materialize. Instead, an enormous serpentine head separates from the tallest peak as you realize the greatest of these mountains is no mountain at all."
15,Couatl,"A resplendent vision hovers in the air, a dream made flesh, winged but unflappable. Its serpentine body whirls and drifts like a trail of smoke made of glittering scales. Amid this intoxicating kaleidoscope, two eyes hold still, their gaze expressing perfect calm and infinite compassion."
16,Deal with the Devil,"Seated at a throne cast in darkness is a horned form, crimson skin cast with sinister shadows from two glowing red points of light. He stands on hoofed feet and steps into the light, revealing the rest of his face. His mouth, framed by a dark goatee, is curled in a devious grin, revealing a mouth full of too-sharp scintillatingly white teeth. His imposing figure towers over you, garbed in high-quality silks and linen. The long thin fingers of his right hand, each ending in a pitch-black pointed claw, firmly grasp his staff—night-black, topped with a ruby cut with 666 facets that glimmer menacingly in the light, each refraction projecting images of tortured souls onto the surrounding surfaces. He asks in a velvet tone, "" Shall we begin?"""
17,Demogorgon,"The towering entity of scaly flesh and bristling fur defies belief. A fiendish and maddening mingling of reptile and ape, the beast’s tendril limbs and barbed tail writhe and coil as it shifts its immense weight. A pair of demonic heads—each with a sloping, brutish forehead and elongated, toothy maw—gaze in all directions with eyes glowing like hot embers. A stench, like rotting meat and smoldering brimstone, wafts from the beast’s steaming mouths."
18,Drow,"The cloaked figure is an elf, the lithe body and easy grace give up the game immediately. A lock of shockingly white hair falls out of the hood, and when they raise a hand to tuck it back in, you realize with a shock that what you thought were dark gloves are in fact the drow’s jet black skin."
19,Dust Mephit,"The strange, impish creature flits about on thin, leathery wings. The smell of dust and mildew precedes its approach, and grit seems to fall constantly from its gray, stone-like skin. It leads its flight with a hawkish nose, beady eyes flashing with cunning as it descends."
20,Earth Genie,"<p style=""text-align: right;"">~ <a href=""https://dscryb.com/scene-request/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Envisioned</a> by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/MrRhexx/featured"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">MrRhexx</a></p>"
21,Emaciated Ghoul,"The emaciated humanoid moves on clawed, skeletal feet. Bits of rotten flesh hang from its skeletal frame, draped haphazardly over the exposed ribs, hips, and arms. Tangled mops of hair—some dried blood red, others black and matted—cover what’s left of its head and shoulders. It drools, rotting teeth filling its maw, and its eyes burn with an otherworldly hunger."
22,Flesh Cobbler,"<p style=""text-align: right;"">~ An <a href=""https://twitter.com/RPGBOTDOTNET/status/1361721551771496449?s=20"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">RPGBOT.NET Nightmare</a></p>"
23,Flesh Golem,"Surely no one sane would make this puppet of muscle and magic, this inhuman-human thing? Yet you know at a glance that a calm intelligence built the monster. Someone arranged the flesh of many people in a pattern, like a quilt. There’s ritual in the precision of the stitching."
24,Flying Monkeys,"The simian’s wings flap rhythmically, slowly pushing it through the air. A flock of these winged apes flutters about, moving on the whims of the strongest among them. They obey the orders of their leader, as he barks and points about with a bloodied claw."
25,Frost Giant Zombie,"The stench of dead flesh billows from the towering, frost-covered corpse. Bits of rotting skin, hair, and clothing hang off the icy-blue body in tattered ribbons. One arm hangs at the shoulder at an impossible angle, its hand frozen in a claw. The other arm, holding a massive greataxe, is trapped in a pose as if it were about to strike. Chips of ice fall from the body as it lumbers forward."
26,Ghast,"In the darkness, the creature's pallid skin catches your eye; it's almost translucent with black, spiderwebbing veins. They sit crouched, but as you near they rise to their full, staggering height. Gaunt and spindly, with a hunched, skeletal frame, the creature that may have once been human opens its bloody maw to reveal rows of jagged, yellow teeth. A walking corpse, with desiccated flesh pulled taut across warped bones, though the cunning in its eyes gives you pause."
27,Giant Boar,"The giant boar makes a sound like rolling thunder as its hooves pound across the forest floor, charging after some perceived threat to its safety. You try not to think about what its oversized tusks would do to your body at that speed."
28,Giant Eels Under the Ice,"] The ice heaves, then shatters! Fissures splinter out in every direction as bony, cart-sized heads punch through the surface, sending shards flying. The mouths take sweeping bites."
29,Giant Goat,"The goat is almost comical as it chews absently at its feed, but the horns atop the head of this draft-horse-sized creature could deliver quite a wallop if provoked."
30,Giant Shark,"What’s deadlier than the apex predator of the ocean? A giant version, with teeth like scimitars and a bottomless appetite for bloody meat."
31,Gnoll,"A bristle of blood-caked hair forms a matted ridge, running from the creature’s canine head over its hunched back and under hide armor. Spotted fur, stained with filth and gore, covers the parts of the body you can see: a toothy maw, dog-like legs ending in clawed paws, and human-like arms that wield weapons with surprising agility."
32,Gnoll in the Dark,"A grotesque hyena head leers down at you as the creature’s massive humanoid body breaks the darkness at the edge of your torchlight. The smell of rotting flesh and dried blood wafts off a filthy hide, and its yellow eyes blaze with a murderous bloodlust as the beast begins to circle you. A tooth-lined maw hangs open, drooling with the anticipation of tearing meat from bone. Its sinewy muscles tighten as it prepares to leap forward and attack."
33,Goat Demon,"It starts as a whiff, a scent tingling at the edge of your senses. It becomes a wretchedly sweet smell that makes you drool as if your body is about to purge itself of its last meal. A noise—laughter, coughing, gurgling—echoes across the walls; then you see it, a goat’s head peering at you from the darkness. The head begins to rise as it stands—rising four, five, six feet. Its blood-soaked maw and hands flex hungrily and painfully, as if it hasn't eaten in months. A wickedly barbed tail wraps around its hairy, animalistic legs, dripping with viscous venom eager to penetrate flesh. Pustules ooze as it sizes you up, and by the crazed look in its eyes, it has reached its conclusion."
34,Goblin with a Coconut,"<p style=""text-align: right;"">~ <a href=""https://dscryb.com/scene-request/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Envisioned</a> by <a href=""https://www.sanspantsradio.com/podcasts/dd-is-for-nerds/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">D&amp;D is for Nerds</a> (S03E19)</p>"
35,Griffon,"The beast shifts its weight, flicking its wings anxiously. A true sight to behold, the creature mingles lion and eagle, resulting in something grander and more deadly than either. It clicks its beak, and in its eyes you sense courage—and a cunning rare in beasts. It scrapes talons the size of daggers along the stone, eager to take flight."
36,Grotesque Undead Panther Beast,"Sharp yowls of indescribable pain echo through the woods. You turn your head to and fro, looking for the source of the sound, and catch sight of a long dark tail. A large creature dashes between the trees, and then you hear scraping and shuffling as the beast rises over a boulder in front of you. The claws on every one of its six huge paws seem as if they are about to fall off. Their fur is torn and bleeding, with overdeveloped muscles so big they burst through the feline silhouette and reveal the beast to be a grotesque and terrifying imitation of a panther."
37,Guardian Naga,"A snakelike form suddenly stands erect from its coil, eyes gleaming with beatific intelligence tempered by an ironclad sense of duty. Creatures such as this make for powerful sentinels, skilled in magic as well as combat, and have the reputation of serving until—even past—death… if one can manage to defeat such a fell opponent. Sibilant consonants emerge from its serpentine mouth as it speaks, warning you to approach no further."
38,Homunculus Servant,"The little homunculus stands with a subservient posture, its face a blank mask. Its hands are clasped at the waist, and its shoulders are hunched forward. Its body, if it can be called such, is a smattering of fleshy organs held together by slender twine in the shape and size of a child’s doll. As it steps forward, your eyes are drawn to its feet, which are little more than toeless nubs."
39,Howling Werewolf Transformation,"Hunched over and grasping their stomach, the individual’s bones begin to crack as their skin tears. Patches of bloody dark fur rip through, and they twist and writhe as their form shifts. Black talonlike claws push through their fingertips as they lift their canine head and howl. Before you is a mix of man and beast, both and neither at once."
40,Ice Mephit,"A jagged spike of ice glitters in the light. The tiny, multifaceted mountain, filled with cracks, opens, one facet sloughing off, and frost unpeeling from around what you now realize is a humanoid creature unfurling its wings—a whole being composed of ice. Its hollow eyes peer over an icicle nose, cruel features made even more so by the ice and frost that composes them."
41,Infernal Conjuring,"Everyone’s hair stands on end as a shrill unearthly scream rends the air. A weeping beast lies among candles and blood, contorting in agony and mewling as its skin hardens and cracks. A twisted abomination claws its way out from the sacrificial lamb, howling with glee and reeking of brimstone."
42,It’s Got Our Scent,"You break into a sprint, despite the slick cobblestones, and the sheets of frigid rain lashing against your exposed skin. You feel more than hear the beast at your heels, sensing its immense weight as it rushes in for the kill."
43,Kobold,"Shorter than a halfling but of similar build, this orange-skinned humanoid has a reptilian head with pointed, dog-like ears. It wears a clay pot as a hat or helmet, through which it has broken holes for its ears, while in its hand it wields a dagger big enough to serve it like a short sword."
44,Lamia,"The woman whose presence you’ve found so intoxicating changes before your eyes. Shapely legs shimmer and vanish, replaced by a leonine body. The torso remains much as it was, but its beauty becomes cruel, and its smile turns vicious and hungry, revealing sharp teeth."
45,Lemure,"An anguished keening comes from the drooping face of the corpulent, naked body before you—indistinguishably male or female due to the rolls of fat that hang from its body like wax from a candle. It wobbles on stumpy legs as it aimlessly flails its flabby arms and peers about through piggy eyes filmed with cataracts. Bile, from disgust or terror—or both—rises in your throat as you realize its fatty lips have grown too long and bulbous for it to form words."
46,Lich Beneath a Pulsing Crystal,"<a href=""https://dscryb.com/scene/lich-beneath-a-pulsing-crystal/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lich Beneath a Pulsing Crystal</a>"
47,Living Unseen Servant,"A shimmering, translucent humanoid is busy at work cleaning and polishing an item. The incorporeal figure pauses its work to look at you with a kind of dull awareness, its mouth moving in what looks like an attempt at a smile."
48,Lizardfolk Rebellion against Orc Slavers,"Tusked orcs stand over their lizardfolk servants with foul-smelling and gore-ridden whips in their hands. The crack of leather and bone on scaly flesh is met with silent hisses of anger. The whip cracks again, but instead of a fleshy thud, there is a grunt of confusion from the orc taskmaster. A scaled claw holds the whip in its grip. Wet and slimy teeth are revealed as the lizardfolk bares their fangs. They spit out something in a foreign tongue and are met with undulating cries from around the camp. Revolution has begun."
49,Lycanthrope Battle,"The beast is upon you, charging in on all fours. Wicked claws and gleaming teeth flash in the moonlight as it lunges. You move aside just in time and the lupine creature skids to a halt, whirling to attack yet again. You behold its horrific visage in the moonlight: a sneering, wolf-like snout—eyes alight with an unnatural cunning."
50,Manticore on Mountain Pass,"The mixed sound of human scream and big-cat roar booms off the canyon walls as gigantic bat-like wings hold a nine-hundred-pound lion body above the edge of the cliff. Its grotesque human face is surrounded by a mane of matted, gore-encrusted hair, and the creature’s tail resembles that of a lion but ends in a thick cluster of sharp, iron-hard spines. Suddenly, it snaps its tail forward, cracking it like a whip and sending a volley of three-foot metallic spikes raining down on you."
51,Minotaur at the Door,"The oaken door creaks in protest as what you know to be an enormous humanoid body drives its horrific bovine head into it. Massive black horns relentlessly gore the sturdy wood planks into splinters. Soon it will collapse under the assault, leaving you face-to-face with a bloodthirsty man-bull abomination."
52,Muscular Snakeblooded Humanoid,"The  muscular, tall, dark-skinned woman wears a stern facial expression. Her bouncy, coarse curls, swept up in a bun, appear black at first glance—but seem to have a dark green hue as well. You notice scales over large parts of her face, and though they are similar in tone to her skin, they give her a reptilian resemblance, and her yellowish-green eyes have slits for pupils."
53,Mycophile Shaman,"She stands tall and straight, but her eyes are wild. Her long, dark hair is streaked with white and braided with the strange fungi that sprout in shadowed woodlands. She wears the ’shrooms like jewelry: a necklace of toadstools and a belt of puffballs. In her right hand she carries a staff made of petrified wood, and in her left she holds a curved dagger."
54,Nightmare Nimbus,"Before you stands a creature borne from the recesses of one's darkest nightmares: a shadowy figure that seems to be a twisted cross between a mantis and a serpent. It is surrounded by a multitude of malicious floating eyes, which seem to echo with the agonized voices of its victims—who may never wake again. Perhaps you wonder, as you stare at the wicked visage transfixed upon your comrades, if you will soon meet the same fate. Or possibly suffer much, much worse…"
55,Orc,"It’s a good thing you’re upwind, as you can almost smell the orc just by looking. His hide armor appears stitched together from the fresh skin of whatever creature once bore it. What you can see of the orc’s gray-green skin is caked in filth—including the tusked face with its piggy nose. The muck there seems to have been deliberately placed as some sort of war mask."
56,"Pair of Red, Armored Warriors","<a href=""https://dscryb.com/scene/lich-beneath-a-pulsing-crystal/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lich Beneath a Pulsing Crystal</a>"
57,Pegasus,"The horse's sleek white hair shines with an almost metallic quality—silver, iridescent, gleaming with an otherworldly light. Feathered wings, splendid white as well, unfurl from the horse's sides. A creature of legend, of myth, done little justice even in the most epic tales."
58,Phoenix,"A heat emanates from the birdlike creature before you, its feathers blazing with a strange and wondrous light. Its eyes glow with an otherworldly quality, and as its beak opens, a strange cry issues forth—like a mingling of birdsong and crackling flames."
59,Pixies Goading Tree to Attack Adventurers,"""Stupid, stupid, stupids,"" a squeaky, tiny voice berates you as you and your companions lay low within a dark and twisted oak. ""Yous all going to be smashed now, hehehe."" The ground beneath you begins to rumble as roots are torn free from your hiding spot. Limbs from the tree swipe down at you violently, and the tree blight rises to its full height."
60,Plesiosaurus,"What seems like dozens of sharp teeth bristle in the small serpentine head of this great beast, atop a long neck that snakes away from a whale-like body. Four powerful fins propel it through the water, guided in part by the twisting of a short tail acting as rudder."
61,Red Dragon Lich,"A thick cloud of black smoke covers the field—appearing from nowhere—and the smell of ash fills your nostrils. An enormous form takes shape within the mist: a monster half covered in flaming red scales and half a charred skeleton. Its skeletal wings break the mist that covers the sun behind their torn membranes, and it roars with an otherworldly screech…"
62,Riding a Tamed Hippogriff,"
"
63,Roper,"A fleeting moment of horror blanks out all rational thought: the stalagmite you are passing has sprouted a single red, blinking eye above a slobbering, fanged mouth. Tendrils leap from its body, whipping out to snag the unwary for its next meal, the rocky hide proof against all but the strongest blows."
64,Sailors Enthralled by Sea Hag,"Sailors hang from wooden bulwarks and riggings, straining to identify the source of the ethereal singing drifting through the air. You look around and see the enthused expressions on their faces, their smiles in complete contrast to the vacant stare of their eyes. A lithe, sensual form sits on a rock by the ship, and you feel yourself drawn forward. Right as your senses recalibrate and your mind pulls you sharply back, you notice the form has become an old, deformed woman with a grotesque grin, waving her hands as if pulling on an invisible rope."
65,Satyr,"Ringlets of soft hair frame a distractingly handsome face, but you notice the ram’s horns that protrude from the man’s locks, and similar hair that coils across his bare chest and down his obviously athletic body, trailing toward… a pair of powerful goat legs, furred in similar color."
66,Shambling Mound and Its Victim,"It hits you: the stench of death and decay. The heap moves, constricting around a tiefling trapped beneath it. Crunching and snapping, dark green vines slither and twist in on themselves, forming first a pair of legs, then a torso with arms; something resembling a head—conical and faceless—tops the bizarre form. The bulky creature looms over you, showering you in rotting plant matter."
67,Silver Dragon Wyrmling,"The smell of fresh rain accompanies the presence of this draconic creature. Statuesque in its posture, the beast watches you from a distance with eyes sharp and cunning. An impressive frill extends from its forehead down to the tip of its tail, while the wings tucked against its body end in talons. Its scales, a shade of polished silver, catch the light of the sun as it moves with a strange and alluring grace."
68,Skeleton Warrior,] The final blow to its frame sends individual bones spiraling through the air as if a spring had been sprung—no longer held together by dark magic.
69,Stirge,"The creature—resembling an oversized bulbous mosquito crossed with a bat—descends on you, beady eyes hunting for an easy meal, its skin a mottled orange. A needle-like proboscis protrudes from the thing's grotesque face."
70,Storm Giant’s Speech about Namesakes,"“The difference between us and other giants is as plain to see as our namesakes,” the giant says. His voice thunders across the great hall, as sunlight from the windows behind his throne shines down on him. He stands upright, his laughter heavy like a torrent, and the light is somehow covered by his silhouette, as though he himself were a storm cloud approaching you. “You may inhabit the hills, harness flames, shape stone, thaw frost. But a storm is not a force your people can control. It is not something you can do with as you please, not something that exists to bend to your will.” The javelin in his hand flashes brightly for a moment, blue-hot lightning coursing through weapon and wielder simultaneously. “There are only two things you can do against a storm: weather it… or die.”"
71,Swamp Wyrm,"Sticky-heat had sweat clinging to the scholar's skin as he stumbled through the swampland. Fetid water seeped into his already soaked clothing, as the buzzing of gnats and other insects deafened his ears. A ripple disturbs the scummy surface, possibly from his own struggles—it barely registers as another slip lands him waist deep in the liquid. As he frees a foot from the limb-strangling swamp bed, he looks up from his exertion and is met by a large draconic face, angered emerald eyes within a foot of his own. It rises from the water, scum and moss clinging to its serpentine body as it's chest vibrates, summoning a miasma of pestilence and death from the swamp bed. The scholar’s lungs become choked, eyes sting, his limbs flail . . . Will he succumb to the Wyrm of the swamp?"
72,Swarm of Small Humanoid Plants,"Were there a single creature, you might find it charming—even cute. But over a dozen of them emerge from the underbrush, each sprinting atop two legs composed of coiled roots. They reach for you with arms made up of twigs, and their faces, knotworks of branches and green vines, twist into expressions of macabre anticipation."
73,Terror in the Night,"Mist veils the moonless night, choking words with foreboding. Amid the swirling cloudscape a flickering flame draws your gaze, its alluring light drawing closer as a thunder rolls over the fog. The thunder resolves into the pounding of hooves on earth, which hails the mist changing to smog. A black figure reveals itself, sucking in the dark, while the horse’s mane flickers from orange to a lurid crimson light."
74,The Amber Sleeper,"As the rotten wood falls away from the tree, you can see into the chamber beyond. Amber seeps from the walls, forming frozen streams of orange and gold that glow under the light of your torch. Your eyes are drawn to the far side of the room, where a vast river of the ancient sap once flowed from a great wound in the tree's inner layers. A dark figure looms inside the amber, frozen for centuries. One of the figure's limbs is outstretched toward you, and you spot a valuable item clasped in its prehistoric claws."
75,The Horror in the Shattered Mirror,"The shards of the mirror sparkle in the moonlight, the dancing fey creatures on the gilded frame grinning at you malevolently as you take a hesitant step forward. You dart your head down to look into the shards, trying to see whether the horrific image you saw earlier is still there. You freeze. Instead of two soulless onyx eyes, each shard reflects its own pair right back at you. The broken glass begins to ooze with black liquid—whatever was trapped inside the mirror has now been bestowed its freedom."
76,The Ogre’s Family,"You follow the two small dark-skinned traders into the bush. Four sets of yellow eyes follow your progress from the shadows of a treehouse about eight feet up, just above the bushes surrounding the tree. You hear a grunt and the treehouse suddenly lurches away from the tree! There are two heavy thumps as a nine-foot-tall humanoid steps forward. ""Found food?"" it asks in a deep gravelly voice. ""Yes, found food!"" The higher-pitched voices echo from the shack resting on the ogre's shoulders."
77,Transformation into Werebear,"Their eyes flash with a bestial cunning just before their form slouches, contorts. Bones crack then slide into place. Flesh reshapes itself. Fur, coarse and black, grows in an instant as the creature's hands elongate into clawed paws. The face stretches, becoming a snout, and, as their mouth opens in a mingling of human scream and bear's roar, wicked teeth sprout from their gums. Where a moment before stood a person, a massive bear now bares its fangs."
78,Warhorse Skeleton,"The clatter of its hooves rings hollow. The fleshless articulation before you is surely lighter than a living horse, but it’s also as if the skeletal creature’s feet carry with them the echoes of a tomb. Its cracked skull rears and its jaw moves, but it makes no sound other than the rattle and creak of bones."
79,Wererat Transformation,"The halfling pauses—looking at you as if considering something. Suddenly, his mouth opens in a silent scream as the transformation begins. Fur sprouts from his spine, claws burst from his fingers, and his teeth elongate. The grotesque creature before you gnashes its long front teeth, and lunges to attack."
80,Young Copper Dragon,"Shadows obscure the hills, and from them a serpentine creature the size of an ox emerges with an otherworldly grace, wings tucked tight against its sides. The dappled sunlight catches scales of gleaming copper. A hiss issues forth, reptilian, as the creature regards you with cunning eyes and slowly circles—watching and waiting."
81,Young Gold Dragon,"The golden body moves in flight with such sinuous grace it’s like you’re seeing music manifested in muscular form. Your brain identifies the shining creature as a dragon, but for the moment awe overcomes any terror you might feel."
82,Zombie,"Rot bloats the flesh of the corpse, and what blood remains runs black. This body has no right to stand, let alone shuffle forward on dragging feet. Its head leans sickly to one side of the correct position atop the neck, and the tight fists it has made clearly have broken fingers. Lungs that should not work push out a gurgling wheeze from the creature’s collapsed throat, sending a gout of dark fluid from between its broken lips."
83,Zombie Clot,"The horde approaches rapidly, the groaning and stink of putrid flesh striking your senses like the vanguard of the incoming army of undead. They trip over one another, undulating like waves of the sea, and roll into a rising mass. Out comes an arm, then another, both made of amalgamations of undead limbs and faces. Just short of a few paces from you and your companions, the mass rears back—like the final crest of a wave before it crashes—and stands fully upright, a monster of monsters. It groans with the voice of a thousand zombies and charges forward, hungry for more bodies to add to its menagerie."
